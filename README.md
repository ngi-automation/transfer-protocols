## Description ##
This document describes how to set up the automated transfer protocols for the Agilent NGS Workstation created at NGI Stockholm.

## Requirements ##
- Agilent NGS Workstation :warning: <i><b>Option B only</i></b>
- Consumables
   - Eppendorf twin.tec 96 PCR plate (Eppendorf, cat# 0030 128.672 (int); 951020460 (US))
   - Nunc deepwell 1.3 mL plate (Thermo Scientific, cat# 260251)
   - ABgene 2.2 mL storage plate Mk.II (Thermo Scientific, cat# AB-0933)
- Deepwell plate adaptor on position 6 (Agilent Technologies, cat# G5498B#012) and supporting device file
- Labware definitions*
- Liquid classes definition*

\* provided in `all_labware_liquids.vzp`

#### Included files ####
```
transfer.pro
transfer_dilution.pro
transfer_form.VWForm
transfer_lib.js

```

## Installation ##
### Download files ###

##### Using Git #####
Clone into `https://github.com/ngi-automation/transfer-protocols.git` from the `Protocol Files` directory:

```bash
cd "C:\VWorks Workspace\Protocol Files"
git clone https://github.com/ngi-automation/transfer-protocols.git
```

Alternatively, download the compressed folder from:
[`https://github.com/ngi-automation/transfer-protocols/archive/master.zip`][zip]
and extract to `C:\VWorks Workspace\Protocol Files`. Rename the resulting `transfer-protocols-master` folder to `transfer-protocols`. The path to the folder containing the extracted files should then be `C:\VWorks Workspace\Protocol Files\transfer-protocols`.

### Configure ###
#### Labware and and liquid class definitions ####
Use the import feature in VWorks from `File â€º Import`in the toolbar and select the `all_labware_liquids.vzp` file included. See the [VWorks Knowledge Base][import] for more information.

#### Device files ####
Device files and profiles are system specific and will not be provided. The following Bravo configuration is used in the transfer protocols:

##### Standard configuration #####
Position | Type | Part#
-------: | ---- | -----
1, 2, 8  | Deck Platepad | `G5498b#004`
3        | Mirrored Barcode Reader | `G5498B#031`
4, 6     | Peltier Thermal Station (Inheco) | `G5498b#021`
5        | Orbital Shaking Station | `G5498b#033`
7        | Magnetic Bead Accessory | `G5498b#008`
9        | Thermal Station (ThermoCube) | `G5498b#036`/`7`/`8`

For reference see Agilent's [accessories catalog][catalog] for the Bravo.

Each `.pro` file must have the correct device file set. See the [VWorks Knowledge Base][device-file] for more information on how to select the device file.
